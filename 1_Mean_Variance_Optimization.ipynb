    "# Global Equity Portfolio Optimization and External Manager Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Global Equity portfolio invested in 5 external managers and 2 subportfolios managed internally. The portfolio is designed to generate long term investment return while maintain moderate risk compared to benchmark MSCI World Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the past years, the performance of the portfolio is not perfoming as expected. To better understand how to allocate capital in different fund managers, I perform the portfolio opimization technique to get the highest possible returns, sharp ratios, with given risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the opitmal weights, we backtest the performance on different weighted portfolios. We found that the current portfolio is not the best performed one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the estimated return is based on history data which could be challenged.\n",
