        "# Portfolio Selection Optimization\n",
        "This model is an example of the classic [Markowitz portfolio selection optimization model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markowitz_model). We want to find the fraction of the portfolio to invest among a set of stocks that balances risk and return. It is a Quadratic Programming (QP) model with vector and matrix data for returns and risk, respectively. This is best suited to a matrix formulation, so we use the Gurobi Python *matrix* interface. The basic model is fairly simple, so we also solve it parametrically to find the efficient frontier.\n",
        "\n",
        "*The python notebook aims to replicate the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization ran by Joel in July. The asset class return and covariance metrix are assumptions by Actuarial team from Ortech. The mean return assumptions is the 10 year net nominal returns with currency overlay to GBP currency, the covariance matrix is the simulated return derived covariance matrix.*\n",
